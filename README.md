# Blog Platform Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Blog Platform. It is built using React (or your preferred framework) and is designed to work with the backend API for the blog platform. It includes pages for viewing posts, user authentication, profile management, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stopitmane/blog-platform-frontend.git
Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash

cd blog-platform-frontend
Create a virtual environment:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
  ```bash
  npm install

Development Setup
Start the development server:

After the dependencies have been installed, start the local development server:

```bash

npm start

This will run the app in development mode and should automatically open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).

Create a .env file:

If your project requires environment variables (e.g., API URLs, authentication tokens), create a .env file at the root of the project and add your environment variables there. Example:

bash
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
